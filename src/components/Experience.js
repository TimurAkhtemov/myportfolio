      <h4>Blueprint Fellowship Program, Rutgers University, New Brunswick</h4>
      <h5>Software Engineer Fellow (February 2021 - April 2021)</h5>
      <p>Early in 2021, I began my journey into the field of software engineering by participating in the Blueprint Fellowship Program,
        a highly selective and intensive computer science program at Rutgers University.
        Here, I gained my first hands-on experience in programming, algorithm design, and data structures.
        This challenging introduction set a strong foundation for my future advanced coursework in computer science and related fields.
        It also provided me with the opportunity to learn from industry experts and develop a solid understanding of key software development concepts.</p>

      <h4>NYU Langone Health, New York NY</h4>
      <h5>Software Engineer Intern (Full stack) (July 2022 - September 2022)</h5>
      <p>As my skills grew, so did my responsibilities. In the summer of 2022, I took on a role as a Full-Stack Software Engineer Intern at NYU Langone Health.  
        Here, I contributed significantly to the design, development, and testing of a proprietary application aimed to revolutionize the organ transplant process.
        My work involved reducing the time to determine compatibility using React.js, Python, Flask API, and MySQL.</p>
      <p>Throughout the process, I analyzed data from the HLA database, comparing hundreds of thousands of specific alleles to determine organ transplant compatibility between patients.
         This required me to work closely with the research team, ensuring correct algorithmic logic by providing weekly updates on the web application and receiving useful insights from recognized research associates.</p>
      <p>Working within an Agile development process, including scrum, daily standup, and planning,  
        I honed my teamwork and communication skills, learning how to collaborate effectively within a dynamic and fast-paced environment.</p>
